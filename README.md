# Hillcrest React Developer Volunteer

## Introduction

This is my initial edit of the Hillcrest-React page. Stay tuned for more information, as well as screenshots and code snippets.

One of the projects I am currently working on is the website of a Portland church called Hillcrest. The purpose of this project is to create a responsive one-page React application. Since I am currently the sole developer, I have the unique opportunity to plan out my own process and thus far I have completed several [front end tasks](#front-end-tasks) and [back end tasks](#back-end-tasks). In the near future, I will work on updating Hillcrest's website for the parts of administration who are not technically saavy and want to easily manage what displays in their website.
