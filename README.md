# Hillcrest React Developer Volunteer

## Introduction

This is my initial edit of the Hillcrest-React page. Stay tuned for more information, as well as screenshots and code snippets.

One of the projects I am currently working on is the website of a Portland church called Hillcrest. The purpose of this project is to create a responsive one-page React application. Since I am currently the sole developer, I have the unique opportunity to plan out my own process and thus far I have completed several [front end tasks](#front-end-tasks) and [back end tasks](#back-end-tasks). In the near future, I will work on updating Hillcrest's website for the parts of administration who are not technically savvy and want to easily manage what displays in their website.

## Front End Tasks

* [Navbar](#navbar)
* [Front Page](#front-page)
* [Footer](#footer)

### Navbar

My task was to create a hamburger menu for mobile screens that responsively expands to a navigation bar for larger screen sizes.

#### This is my code for the Navbar functions:

    <div>
        TODO
    </div>

#### The following code is for automatically taking the user to the top of the screen each time a page link is selected. The scroll location would otherwise stay saved even after transitioning. This creates the appearance of multiple pages in a single-page application.

    <div>
        TODO
    </div>

#### CSS code:

    /*************************************/
    /* TODO */
          
    /* END TODO */
    /*****************************************/

### Front Page

My task was to create a basic front page layout that responds to the size of the user's screen. 

#### Screenshot of the Front Page on a mobile display:

#### CSS Code:

     /*************************************/
    /* TODO */
          
     /* END TODO */
    /*****************************************/

### Footer

While creating the footer, I wanted to have a sense of balance between the top and the bottom of the screen, so I added a footer image with Hillcrest's name in front of it. This is followed by a solid bar containing social media buttons.

#### Screenshot:

#### CSS Code:

    /* ------------------- TODO ------------------- */
    
    /* ----------------- END TODO ----------------- */
